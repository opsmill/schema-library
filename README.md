# Infrahub Schema Library

Welcome to the Schema Library for Infrahub! This repository offers a collection of schemas designed to streamline and standardize infrastructure-related data structures.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently a collection of examples intended to serve as inspiration. Please note that it is in an experimental phase and may undergo significant changes.

## Use case

Infrahub ships without built-in schemas, giving you complete freedom to define your own. However, starting from scratch can be overwhelming, especially when many infrastructures share common models. That's where the [Schema Library](https://github.com/opsmill/schema-library), maintained by OpsMill and the community, comes in.

**The library provides a curated collection of practical, ready-to-use schemas designed to reflect real-world infrastructure needs. Use them out of the box, or treat them as a foundation: copy, adapt, and extend each schema to align precisely with your organization.**
