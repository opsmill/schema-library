# Infrahub Schema Library

Welcome to the Schema Library for Infrahub! This repository offers a collection of schemas designed to streamline and standardize infrastructure-related data structures.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently a collection of examples intended to serve as inspiration. Please note that it is in an experimental phase and may undergo significant changes.

## Use case

Infrahub comes without schemas out of the box. However, we don't want you to reinvent the wheel. You can use the schema library to scaffold your own schemas, allowing you to focus development on parts specific to your organization.

You can also use the schemas in this repository as references or examples to craft your own.
