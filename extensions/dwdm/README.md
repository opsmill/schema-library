# DWDM schema extension

This schema extension contains models for DWDM.
With some vendors, the tunable optics are not configured via the channel number but via the wavelength and/or the frequency. This model is to have a unique entry in Infrahub for those.

## Nodes

- DwdmChannel

## Generics

## Dependencies

- Base

#TODO: when we have a proper `optic` schema, we could link those DwdmChannel to it.
