  # This implementation of MlagDomain is very minimalist
  # The goal is to make it easy to blend with existing models you might have
  # e.g. if you are operating in a data center fabric environment you might already have a LeafGroup or similar concept
  # In that case you can have your LeafGroup inherit from GenericMlagDomain
  # and add the necessary relationships/attributes to it following MlagDomain node example below
