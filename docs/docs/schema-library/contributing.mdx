We welcome contributions and feedback! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to suggest additions, improvements or to report bugs.

To add a new example, follow these steps:

- Create a directory in `experimental` with the name of the schema example
- Create a `<example_name>.yml` file using the [Infrahub schema format](https://docs.infrahub.app/reference/schema)
- Update `.metadata.yml` file to include the schema you have created with a `name`, `descriptions` and `dependencies`.
- `invoke build` will then generate a `README.md` file for the schema.
